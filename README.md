# SAM-project

The **Exam Management System** is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the management of exams at a university. The system accommodates several functionalities, such as:

- **Exam Registration**: Allows students to register for exams.
- **View Subscriptions**: Allow students to see all their exam subscriptions.
- **View Courses**: Allow viewing the list of the courses offered.
- **Insert a Course**: Allow teachers to create a new course.
- **View Exam Calls**: Allow viewing all the published exam dates.

## Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture** consisting of the following layers:

- **Domain Model**: Represents the core entities of the system such as `Student`, `Teacher`, `Course`, `Exam`, and `Enrollment`.
- **Data Access Objects (DAOs)**: Interacts with the database and encapsulates the details of data persistence.
- **Service Layer**: Manages business logic and interacts with DAOs to execute necessary operations.
- **Resource Layer**: Exposes services through JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services), enabling easy integration with client applications or other systems.

The system uses **Java Persistence API (JPA)** to manage interactions with a **MySQL database**, which is hosted in a Docker container for ease of deployment and scalability.

**Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)** is used to manage dependencies among different layers of the application to ensure a modular and easy-to-maintain code base.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or later**
- **Maven**
- **Docker**
- **Docker compose**

### Setting up MySQL with Docker

The MySQL database is containerized using **Docker**. To start the database container, run the following command in the project directory:
<code>docker-compose up -d</code>

### Running the Application
1. Build the application JAR file with dependencies:
   <code>mvn clean package</code>
2. Launch the application using the generated JAR file:
   <code>java -jar target/examManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>

Inside the project directory, there is also the [setupData.sh](com.corbinelli.giamberini.examManagement/setupData.sh) file that can be used to insert some records in the DB.
